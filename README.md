# Heardle Game
This is a game inspired by "Heardle" seen here: https://heardlewordle.io/ where players are given increasingly longer snippets of random music and they have to guess what the song is. This implementation utilizes the Spotify API to allow users to use their own music and select which playlist to play music from. 

This project was my first exploration into using API's, so it was an incredible valuable learning experience. 

## Setup
To play this game, one just needs to replace the current access tokens with thier own. Consult the spotify developer page here to learn more about retrieving access/secret tokens: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started
