# Heardle Game
This is a game inspired by "Heardle" seen here: https://heardlewordle.io/ where players are given increasingly longer snippets of random music and they have to guess what the song is. This implementation utilizes the Spotify API to allow users to use their own music and select which playlist to play music from. 

This project was my first exploration into using API's, so it was an incredible valuable learning experience.
